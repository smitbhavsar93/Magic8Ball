and try running it on your physical iPhone device. 

## Xcode 12.3
This program was coded on Xcode 12.3, meaning it can run on any iOS devices iOS 14.3 and above (but of course, you can turn down the iOS version manually).

## Template Credits
The open source template and/or images I used was from here GitHub, whereby I cloned their existing project to acquire the images that I needed to make this app
work. I owe credit to them for allowing me to use their images, however everything thereby was hardcoded by yours truly. Link to the template is : https://github.com/appbrewery/Magic-8-Ball-iOS13 made by AppBrewery.
